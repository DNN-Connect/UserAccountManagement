        <h2>
            * Important *</h2>
        <p>
            When creating a project using this template, you should have named your project
            simply "ModuleName", not "DotNetNuke CorporationModuleName". If you didn&#39;t do this, the
            easiest thing to do is close the solution, delete the folder from your DesktopModules
            folder, then create a new project.</p>
        <p>
            Due to limitations in the templating capabilities of Visual Studio, you will need
            to make some minor changes, and double check a few things, before you package this module.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong style="font-weight: bold;">BEFORE</strong> checking the
                module into your source control environment check the following.</li>
            <li>Edit the Project properties by double-clicking on the Properties folder in Solution
                Explorer</li>
            <li>On the Application tab:
                <ol>
                    <li>Make sure the Assembly name textbox is set to "Connect_AccountRegistration".</li>
                    <li>Make sure the Default namespace is set to "DotNetNuke.Modules.Connect_AccountRegistration".</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>On the Web tab:
                <ol>
                    <li>Under 'Start Action', make sure to set your Start URL to the correct site (ex: http://dnndev/).</li>
                    <li>Under 'Servers', make sure to "Use IIS Web Server" with a project url of http://dnndev/desktopmodules/Connect_AccountRegistration
                        and an Override application root URL of http://dnndev/</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>
            Steps after your project is setup.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To Build and Package your Module you need to change to <b>Release</b> mode and then
                simply choose Build from the Build menu. The MSBuild scripts will do the packaging
                process for you. The packaging process creates an INSTALL and a SOURCE package in
                the PACKAGES folder within your desktopmodule/modulename folder. </li>
            <li>Installing your module in your development DotNetNuke instance is easy.Take the
                SOURCE ZIP file that is created in the Packages folder, upload that using the Host/Extensions
                page, Installation Wizard. </li>
            <li>After you've done a release for your module (typically deploying to an environment
                outside of your development environment) you should change the Version number, you
                need to do this in two places, the assemblyinfo file, and the .DNN manifest file.
                Next time you build the module in release mode you will get a new package (using
                the version number) created.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>
            After you are finished with the Documentation you can delete the Documentation directory
            from your project.
